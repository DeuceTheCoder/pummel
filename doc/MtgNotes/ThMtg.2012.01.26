Review prior to-dos:
Moving objects without duplication has been fixed.

Need to create a pert or gant chart.

Compiling SSDD and SSRS is working now, with the exception of a missing png file (fixed).

Theora, Alex will clarify where uml drawing classes are called.

Alex will restructure the directories, update the code.


Discussed class diagram audit:
There should be a print framework - likely its own class (inherit from QPrinter)

Does the drawing area handle the background grid, or should this be a class?

OptionsDialog related - will it check for a preferences file? Will this be handled by the OptionsDialog class or a dedicated class?
Are these options (shapeColor, shapeFill, etc) global, or per "Objects" object? If the latter, then ToolBar may call functions, but the 
Objects class would receive the actual settings, method calls, etc.
(The former - new icons will use the last property (color etc) set via optionsDialog.)

What handles the Project (multiple documents)?
How are documents within a single project linked?

Help could be its own simple class, for the sake of easy modification. Toolbar would call it.



Assignments:
Austin will create the html file for the assignment.

Adrian will create the tex file with our gant chart in it.

Jason will upload our gant chart (openProj) and a graphic export of it (for the tex file).
Jason will submit the uml diagram sources to the repo.

David will update the class diagram.

Alex will refine the source code, focusing on main window, structure the source files in the repo.
Alex will send out the location of the Qt Creator project file.
