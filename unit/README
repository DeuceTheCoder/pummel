to run a unit test, you first need to run the setup script.
this simply goes into the src/ direcory and builds the project
in order to generate the .o files for linking. this may take
a little while.

>>$ ./setup.sh

then run the shell script wrapper that executes the
makefile using the command line arg that specifies
the test you want to run (look in the tests dir):

>>$ ls tests
ut_file.h

>>$ make ut_file

after you have done this just run the resulting executable:

>>$ ./ut_file.ut
Running 1 test.OK!


you can also build and run all the tests at once using the all directive:

>>$ make all
