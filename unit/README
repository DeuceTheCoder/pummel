to run a unit test, you first need to run the setup script.
this simply goes into the src/ direcory and builds the project
in order to generate the .o files for linking. this may take
a little while.

>>$ ./setup.sh


then run the makefile using the command line arg that 
specifies the test you want to run (look in the tests dir):

>>$ ls tests
test_dragitem.h

>>$ make test_dragitem


after you have done this just run the resulting executable:

>>$ ./test_dragitem
Running 1 test.OK!


you can also build and run all the tests at once using the 
all directive:

>>$ make all


look in the makefile itself for instructions on how to add
your tests to the build.
