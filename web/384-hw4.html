<h2>Code Estimation</h2>
<p>

<p>link we used: http://www.sju.edu/~jhodgson/se/estimates.html</p>

<br>currently 137 function points accoring to above link, this means we 
<br>should have 20,550 lines of code. we are unsure of the validity of
<br>this estimate considering we only have 2200 lines of code at the moment.

<h2>Pair Programming Experiences</h2>
<h3>Coleman Beasley</h3>
<p>
For pair programming, I worked with Alex on z-stacking of icons.  We were trying to figure out 
ways to get stacked icons to select in the order they were last moved, rather than the order 
in which icons were drawn on the drawing area.
</p>
<p> 
We weren't able to figure out z-stacking in our pair programming session, but I was able to learn 
more about how our project worked.  Alex and I also were able to bounce several ideas off of each other, 
and get a few of them implemented/ruled out.  I thought it made us more productive than working in a 
larger group, and at the same time it allowed us to share ideas and knowledge in ways that we couldn't have 
if we worked on our own.
</p>

<h3>Alex Dean</h3>
<p>I worked with Coleman on using the zValue of the QGraphicsItem's to make the objects on the canvas stack properly with each other.  The idea was that the last item that was clicked or touched should be on the top.  The hard part was not moving an item to the top, but more of preserving the state of the objects below it and not running into memory problems, such as incrementing the zValue past 32767.
</p>
<p>
Although we didn't actually get the zValue working, I enjoyed the pair programming experiment because it allowed us to catch flaws in each others ideas before we went and coded them and just had the program crash in creative ways.  The benefit of having someone looking over your shoulder and helping you watch for code mistakes (semicolons...) is really hard overlook.
</p>

<h3>Austin Enfield</h3>
<p>
For teh pair programming I worked with Theora Rice.  We worked for a few hour to lay out the 
base object class, the ellipse class, and write unit tests for both of them.  I think that 
this was a very working and helpfull experience.  With the help of two eyes on the same 
screen both looking from two differenet perspective it really helped.  It made it in way one 
that was thinking about it then writing it to screen, where the other was reading it from 
screen then thinking about it.  It helped to catch all the smaller errors made in things such 
as misspellings or missed semi-colons.
</p>
<p>
The other thing that I think this helped a lot with was the integration of new team members 
into the code.  Its is a little harder to just jump into the coding part if all you have to 
go off of is source code and diagrams that are constantly under review, so this was extremely
helpfull to me.  It helped me understand the scope of the code because i was working with 
someone who had been on the team last semester and had done much of the programing, so i was 
able to ask questions.  From these question I got the basic understanding of the code and then 
as we continued to work on it, my understanding continued to grow.  Overall i think it was a 
worthy, smart, and well apreciated assignment.

<h3>Jason Fletcher</h3>
<p>For this exercise, I worked with Cable Johnson. We were planning on continuing work on tabs,
including associating each tab with its own individual drawArea, but by the time we met another
team member had already solved that particular problem (not that we complained). We spent a good
part of our time looking at the restructured code and trying to fix smaller details (such as the
entire pathname being displayed when the 'open' or 'save' dummy-functions were invoked), as well as
moving on to the issue of file I/O itself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, partway through we had some issues with QT getting angry when it tried to compile,
which slowed our progress, but we did find some useful built-in QT classes for handling XML.
Working as a pair was especially useful for researching new classes and functions, as one of us
would spot a built-in function that worked especially well in our situation, which the other might have missed. On the
whole, I think pair programming works well for our project; we moved fast and both put a good deal of effort
in. Further, Cable and I have agreed to meet again on Thursday for another session, to work more with the
basics of our saving and loading.</p>

<h3>Cable Johnson</h3>
<p>
During this pair programming session I worked with Jason Fletcher. We initially were going to
work on tabs and make each tab contain its own canvas, but realized by the time we got there
someone else had already for the most part done this. However, we were able to figure out how
the tab structure works and also fix minor things, like what the tab itself displays.
So after we played with tabs for a bit we jumped into file I/O, mostly initial stubbing
of the methods and figuring out what xml writer we wanted to use. We will be meeting again
to continue to work on file I/O and also unit testing.
</p>
<p>
Overall I liked the pair programming style. Unfortunately we spent a good bit of time fixing
a broken build at the start, but once we got into the swing of things we started producing code
in a timely fashion. I definitely plan on having more pair programming sessions throughout the
semester.

<h3>Adrian Norris</h3>

<h3>Theora Rice</h3>
<p>
I was paired with Austin Enfield, and found the experience to be very enjoyable.
We worked together on coding objects, including the test code, and made more progress
towards the end goal then we might have made otherwise. By working together, with 
one on the computer, one watching, we were able to catch a lot of small mistakes
that could have taken a long time to track down. We were also able to better orient our programing 
responsibilities more towards what the entire group would understand. 
</p>
<p> 
Research was also easier to do, since one person could be writing code and the 
other thinking of the code in the larger scheme of things. Austin and I would code 
a block or so, then think of something to research. Since we both had different methods 
of researching, this led to different results. 
</p>
<p>
Overall I think the experience was really useful. I'd like to do most of the programming
this way in the future, since it seems to prevent a lot of small mistakes.
It also works to keep the project more team oriented, rather than developing into
single bits of code with different coding styles.

<h3>David Summers</h3>
<p>
I was paired with Adrian Norris for our pair programming exercise. For me it was a very positive experience and I look forward to doing more of it. We began working on drawing lines. Adrian suggested that we both come prepared by having reviewed the tutorial <a href='http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/graphicsview-diagramscene.html'>Diagram Scene Example</a>. This was good because it gave us both a common tarting ground. At the same time, it was interesting to see where our understandings and ideas diverged.
</p><p>
We had scheduled a second session for this evening (Feb 21) to work on integrating what we wrote last time into the project. I was, unfortunately, unable to make it due to medical reasons. I do look forward to making it up though.
