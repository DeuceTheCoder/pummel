<h2>Pair Programming Experiences</h2>
<h3>Coleman Beasley</h3>
<p>
For pair programming, I worked with Alex on z-stacking of icons.  We were trying to figure out 
ways to get stacked icons to select in the order they were last moved, rather than the order 
in which icons were drawn on the drawing area.
</p>
<p> 
We weren't able to figure out z-stacking in our pair programming session, but I was able to learn 
more about how our project worked.  Alex and I also were able to bounce several ideas off of each other, 
and get a few of them implemented/ruled out.  I thought it made us more productive than working in a 
larger group, and at the same time it allowed us to share ideas and knowledge in ways that we couldn't have 
if we worked on our own.

I was paired with Austin Enfield, and found the experience to be very enjoyable.
We worked together on coding objects, including the test code, and made more progress
towards the end goal then we might have made otherwise. By working together, with 
one on the computer, one watching, we were able to catch a lot of small mistakes
that could have taken a long time to track down. We were also able to better orient our programing 
responsibilities more towards what the entire group would understand. 
</p>
<p> 
Research was also easier to do, since one person could be writing code and the 
other thinking of the code in the larger scheme of things. Austin and I would code 
a block or so, then think of something to research. Since we both had different methods 
of researching, this led to different results. 
</p>
<p>
Overall I think the experience was really useful. I'd like to do most of the programming
this way in the future, since it seems to prevent a lot of small mistakes.
It also works to keep the project more team oriented, rather than developing into
single bits of code with different coding styles.

I was paired with Adrian Norris for our pair programming exercise. For me it was a very positive experience and I look forward to doing more of it. We began working on drawing lines. Adrian suggested that we both come prepared by having reviewed the tutorial <a href='http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7-snapshot/graphicsview-diagramscene.html'>Diagram Scene Example</a>. This was good because it gave us both a common tarting ground. At the same time, it was interesting to see where our understandings and ideas diverged.
</p><p>
We had scheduled a second session for this evening (Feb 21) to work on integrating what we wrote last time into the project. I was, unfortunately, unable to make it due to medical reasons. I do look forward to making it up though.
