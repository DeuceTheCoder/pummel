<h2>Pair Programming Experiences</h2>
<h3>Coleman Beasley</h3>
<p>
For pair programming, I worked with Alex on z-stacking of icons.  We were trying to figure out 
ways to get stacked icons to select in the order they were last moved, rather than the order 
in which icons were drawn on the drawing area.
</p>
<p> 
We weren't able to figure out z-stacking in our pair programming session, but I was able to learn 
more about how our project worked.  Alex and I also were able to bounce several ideas off of each other, 
and get a few of them implemented/ruled out.  I thought it made us more productive than working in a 
larger group, and at the same time it allowed us to share ideas and knowledge in ways that we couldn't have 
if we worked on our own.
